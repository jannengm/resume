	%Salutation
	Dear Hiring Manager:\\

	%Intro paragraph - position, reason for interest, why I'm good for the job
	I am contacting you to express my interest in a software development internship for this summer. I had the pleasure of speaking with one of your employees, Danny DeRuiter, at last weeks career fair, and he indicated that you were still looking to hire interns for the summer. Several of my classmates here at Grand Valley, including Danny, work for Salespad, and I've heard great things about the environment there.\\

	I am currently a senior at Grand Valley State University, where I study Computer Science with a minor in mathematics and maintain a 3.903 GPA. At the end of the current academic term, I will have completed all the coursework necessary for a degree, with the exception of the program's internship requirement. Despite not having completed my degree yet, I do have experience with computer related employment. In 2014, I was hired for a temp job at a local factory, Medallion Instrumentation Systems, to help them catch up on a backlog of warranty claims. During my time there, I took the initiative to create new scripts and SQL queries to automate several aspects of the data entry process that had previously been done manually, making the entire process faster and more efficient. Additionally, this past fall term, I was offered a job as a teaching assistant / lab assistant by a professor in whose computer architecture class I did very well during the previous term.\\


	

	Sincerely,
